# 🌸 MY STUPID CODE 🌸

### ⚠️ Please, GTFO I'm stupid

### Why am I here?
* To make things pink.
* To mine for dopamine.
* To pretend I understand how Git works (I don't, I'm just copy-pasting what the AI tells me).

### 🛠️ Technical Skills
* **HTML/CSS:** I can change colors until it hurts your eyes.
* 
> "If it works, don't touch it. If it breaks, I'm deleting this repo (or I can undo)."
