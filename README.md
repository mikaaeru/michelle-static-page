# 🌸 MY STUPID CODE 🌸

### ⚠️ Please, GTFO I'm stupid

### Why am I here?
* Make a landing page.
* To pretend I know how tech works (I vibecoded this shit)

### 🛠️ Technical Skills
* **Linux:** I once performed `sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root` 

> "If it works, don't touch it. If it breaks, I'm deleting this repo (or I can undo)."
